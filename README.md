# The goal of this project is to help you learn about how to use external packages using npm. The user inputs their birthdate via a JavaScript Datepicker, and the app calculates and displays their exact age, including years, and months using Luxon. 
# Requariments:
* A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (avoid the default HTML date picker)
* Use the Luxon library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
* Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
* Implement basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
* Use simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive
